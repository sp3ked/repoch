# Startup Search Engine Project

## Project Overview
A search engine/dashboard focused on discovering startups with poor SEO presence on Google, aiming to:
1. Help consumers find products/startups more easily
2. Increase visibility for startups with limited online presence
3. Potentially integrate with GitHub for open-source project context

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering and improved SEO
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB for flexible schema and scalability
- Search Engine: Elasticsearch for powerful full-text search capabilities
- Web Scraping: Puppeteer for dynamic content scraping
- API Integration: Axios for making HTTP requests to external APIs
- GitHub Integration: Octokit.js for interacting with GitHub API

## Key Components
1. Web Scraper
2. Startup Database
3. Search Algorithm
4. User Interface
5. GitHub Integration Module

## Development Phases
